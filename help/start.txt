Subject: A Gentle Introduction to go/고/庫
vim: tw=72

go/고/庫 lets you synchronize contents of multiple go repositories.  A
go repository is a directory where you have run `go init`.  Under a go
repository, you can either `go push` to send all updated contents to
other repositories, or `go pull` to receive all updates from others.
Repositories must first `go friends` with each other in order to keep in
touch.  Repositories can reside in different hosts or in a same host.
Once a repository is pulling/pushing with another one, you can `go get`
or `go put` or `go set`, `go reset` any file or directory under it to
synchronize only a subset of the whole content.  Technically speaking,
`go` is a thin wrapper for the `rsync` command with a little addition of
pathname and SSH key handlings that will quite annoy us if done manually
with our hands everytime.
